# GitHub Contribution Checker App

On April 25, 2018, Github announced it plans on [shutting down GitHub Services](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/replacing-github-services/). This application can help identify how and where your Accounts are [using GitHub Services](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/replacing-github-services/#migrating-with-our-help).

This app lets you authenticate with GitHub and check whether any of your repositories have a GitHub Service installed.
